        <h5> Travel is not just fun, Its good for your Health and Soul! Here are 10 reasons why you need to travel more:</h5></br>
       
        <ol>
            <li>Travel lowers Stress levels.</li>
            <p> A study found that three days after vacation, travelers felt well-rested, less anxious, and in a better mood. And these improvements didn’t disappear when they returned home, they lasted for weeks afterward. </p>
            
            <li>Travel improves your Brain Health.</li>
            <P> Studies have shown a connection between travel and an increase in creativity, a deeper sense of cultural awareness and personal growth. And according to the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,</br>
            those who travel and study abroad tend to be more open and emotionally stable.</P>
            
            <li>Travel decreases risk of Heart Disease.</li>
            <P>The long-running Framingham Heart Study found that men and women who traveled annually were less likely to suffer a heart attack or develop heart disease.</P>
            
            <li>Travel will let you Live Longer.</li>
            <P> Research shows that travel reduces stress, keeps your body healthy inside and out, and boosts brain health. This adds up to an increased chance of living longer and to having more fun doing it.</P>

            <li>Travel improves Social Communication Skills.</li>
            <P>When you travel you learn how to communicate better with other people. Brushing up your knowledge on the most commonly used phrases or questions tourists ask can help you reach out to and relate better with the locals.</P>            
            
            <li>Travel will help You get Creative Thoughts.</li>
            <P>Travel will help you develop new neural connections that trigger original and creative thoughts, you must explore new places and break out of your daily routine.</P>
            
            <li>Travel gets You Real-life Education.</li>
            <P>Meeting different people from vast cultures and societies provides an education that is impossible to get in a traditional school, college or a university. There is no substitute for the real thing.</P>
            
            <li>Travel creates Memories for Lifetime.</li>
            <P>If you travel with friends and family members, traveling helps you build stronger bonds and make memories. You can also save memories of a lifetime by creating photo albums or sharing photos in social media.</P>
            
            <li>Travel aids you to get to Know Yourself better.</li>
            <P>While traveling, you might find yourself stuck in situations you won’t normally experience in your daily life. This can help you understand yourself and how you react to such circumstances, 
            preparing you for future similar situations.</P>
            
            <li>Travel will introduce You to New People</li>
            <P>You'll meet far more friendly people on the road than you will under ordinary circumstances at home. Other travelers are always looking to share experiences, give tips on places to go, and meet people from all over.</br> 
            Striking up a conversation with other travelers is extraordinarily easy.</P>
